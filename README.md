# HTML Phys_Sim
An AI generated physiscs simulation because I have no experience with JS whatsoever.

# How to use
To control the character, use the left/right arrow keys, and space to jump.

To control jump power (default 4.8), edit the `maxJumps` value.

Every other variable is self-explanatory, just edit the corresponding value.

To modify starting position, you can change the `positionX` and `positionY` variables to set where the player will start (default is top-left, 0,0. bottom-right is your monitor resolution -50 px on each coordinate.)

# Purpose
There isn't really a purpose to this program. It just showcases what AI can create with HTML. I don't plan to add more to this, but I can if I need to.

# Known bugs
Being AI generated, this program can be very prone to bugs, here are a few:

- Player will void collision with the bottom of platforms, making the platforms feel like Mario.
- Not really much else for now, good job ChatGPT!
